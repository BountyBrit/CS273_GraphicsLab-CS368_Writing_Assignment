__Writing Sample Assignment:__ _Graphics Lab_

__Justification__ for changes:
- Java graphics can be confusing to new students and can take quite a while for drawing something complex. This method
  allows students to apply the simple concepts they've learned so far to build complex methods or smplify problems. I
  wrote drawWindow as a seperate method to not confuse the original code.
- drawWindow creates a simple window frame, dictated by the user's input of x and y coordinates, width and heighth, as
  well as color. Then using simple geometry, it draws the window pane always smaller than the frame. This affect shows
  how layering objects on the graphics context can create depth and style within an otherwise simple graphics window.
  Finally, drawWindow creates the horizontal and vertical divisions as the same color as the frame to ensure a clean
  and elegant design. 
  

__Context__ of lab and changes:
- Students are culminating their skills used in each checkpoint in this lab to draw a house which shows their creativity
  through color and design, use of Java's extensive documentation and methods, and commenting code and create space.
- The drawWindow method is a culmination of various skills throughout the lab such as setting
  colors, drawing and filling objects at the correct coordinates, and utilizing parameters and simple geometry to create a
  simple but elegant design.  

__Importance__ of the changes: 
- This method not only helps students with the checkpoint, it helps the instructor show students how they use/manipulate
  Java graphics medthods, explain complex topics in the CS203 curriculum, and assist the TA in explaining checkpoints and 
  concepts during lab time. I made drawWindow a seperate method to teach students how to break up their code and the value
  of helper methods. Students need to learn to not just write good code, but to also write comments and add whitespace to
  make reading and understanding the code easier.
